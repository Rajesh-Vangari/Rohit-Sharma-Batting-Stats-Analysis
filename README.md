Welcome to my latest project, which combines my passion for cricket with data analysis and visualization using Power BI. 📊🏏

Project Overview
With Rohit Sharma’s stellar career across various formats and the IPL, I embarked on a project to analyze his batting statistics in detail. This project utilizes data cleaning and preprocessing with SQL to create a comprehensive Power BI report. Here’s a closer look at what I’ve done:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Data Collection: Gathered detailed batting stats for Rohit Sharma from ESPNcricinfo. The data includes runs scored, averages, strike rates, and centuries across Test, ODI, T20I formats, and the IPL. 🏆
Image Gathering: Collected player images and team logos from the ICC-cricket website to enhance the visual aspects of the report. 🖼
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the data using SQL to ensure it’s in a format suitable for Power BI analysis.
2. Power BI Reports
